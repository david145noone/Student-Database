# Student-Database
* The purpose of this application is to create a concrete end-to-end web application that can handle CRUD instructions to a mySQL database. 
* As part of this project I'm aiming to be able to run some automated testing, write a Dockerfile for the project and use Gradle for the building of the jar file. 
* Finally the front end will be eventually written in either Vue.js or React.js
