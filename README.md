# Student-Database
* The purpose of this application is to create a concrete end-to-end web application that can handle CRUD instructions to a mySQL database. 
* The student dataset comes from the [Open University Learning Analytics dataset](https://analyse.kmi.open.ac.uk/open_dataset#data)
* As part of this project I'm aiming to be able to run some automated testing, write a Dockerfile for the project and use Gradle for the building of the jar file. 
* Finally the front end will be eventually written in either Vue.js or React.js

## Built With

* [Java 8](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/) & [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) - For the backend and routing
* [Gradle](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/userguide.html) - For building and dependency management
* [mySQL](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E17952_01/index.html) - Database management system 
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) - Dockerfile to launch the containers required for the application

## Resources 
An assortment of invaluable learning resources that I've used during the course of this project

* [Java Unit Testing with Gradle](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_testing.html)
